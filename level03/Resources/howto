its a binary saying exploit me

usr/bin/env echo Exploit me is what it does

in /tmp we can create an echo of our own which is what we do

create echo with getflag inside

add /tmp/ to path: export PATH=/tmp:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/
sbin:/bin:/usr/games
(the rest is old path)

dont forget chmod 777 on new echo

done, level03 doesnt launch getflag
